# 9.29. 事件觸發函式

PostgreSQL provides these helper functions to retrieve information from event triggers.

For more information about event triggers, see [Chapter 39](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/event-triggers.html).

## 9.29.1. Capturing Changes at Command End

```
pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands () → setof record
```

`pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands` returns a list of DDL commands executed by each user action, when invoked in a function attached to a `ddl_command_end` event trigger. If called in any other context, an error is raised. `pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands` returns one row for each base command executed; some commands that are a single SQL sentence may return more than one row. This function returns the following columns:

| Name              | Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| `objid`           | `oid`            | OID of the object itself                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `objsubid`        | `integer`        | Sub-object ID (e.g., attribute number for a column)                                                                                                                                                |
| `command_tag`     | `text`           | Command tag                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `object_type`     | `text`           | Type of the object                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `schema_name`     | `text`           | Name of the schema the object belongs in, if any; otherwise `NULL`. No quoting is applied.                                                                                                         |
| `object_identity` | `text`           | Text rendering of the object identity, schema-qualified. Each identifier included in the identity is quoted if necessary.                                                                          |
| `in_extension`    | `boolean`        | True if the command is part of an extension script                                                                                                                                                 |
| `command`         | `pg_ddl_command` | A complete representation of the command, in internal format. This cannot be output directly, but it can be passed to other functions to obtain different pieces of information about the command. |

```
pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects () → setof record
```

`pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects` returns a list of all objects dropped by the command in whose `sql_drop` event it is called. If called in any other context, an error is raised. This function returns the following columns:

| Name              | Type      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| `object_identity` | `text`    | Text rendering of the object identity, schema-qualified. Each identifier included in the identity is quoted if necessary.                                                                                                     |
| `address_names`   | `text[]`  | An array that, together with `object_type` and `address_args`, can be used by the `pg_get_object_address` function to recreate the object address in a remote server containing an identically named object of the same kind. |

The `pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects` function can be used in an event trigger like this:

```
CREATE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_for_drops()
        RETURNS event_trigger LANGUAGE plpgsql AS $$
DECLARE
    obj record;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()
    LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE '% dropped object: % %.% %',
                     tg_tag,
                     obj.object_type,
                     obj.schema_name,
                     obj.object_name,
                     obj.object_identity;
        END LOOP;
END;
$$;
CREATE EVENT TRIGGER test_event_trigger_for_drops
   ON sql_drop
   EXECUTE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_for_drops();
```

## 9.29.3. Handling a Table Rewrite Event

The functions shown in [Table 9.98](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-event-triggers.html#FUNCTIONS-EVENT-TRIGGER-TABLE-REWRITE) provide information about a table for which a `table_rewrite` event has just been called. If called in any other context, an error is raised.

#### **Table 9.98. Table Rewrite Information Functions**

| <p>Function</p><p>Description</p>                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <p><code>pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid</code> () → <code>oid</code></p><p>Returns the OID of the table about to be rewritten.</p>                                                                |
| <p><code>pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason</code> () → <code>integer</code></p><p>Returns a code explaining the reason(s) for rewriting. The exact meaning of the codes is release dependent.</p> |

These functions can be used in an event trigger like this:

```
CREATE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid()
 RETURNS event_trigger
 LANGUAGE plpgsql AS
$$
BEGIN
  RAISE NOTICE 'rewriting table % for reason %',
                pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid()::regclass,
                pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason();
END;
$$;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER test_table_rewrite_oid
                  ON table_rewrite
   EXECUTE FUNCTION test_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid();
```
