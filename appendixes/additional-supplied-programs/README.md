# G. Additional Supplied Programs

This appendix and the previous one contain information regarding the modules that can be found in the `contrib` directory of the PostgreSQL distribution. See [Appendix F](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/contrib.html) for more information about the `contrib` section in general and server extensions and plug-ins found in`contrib` specifically.

This appendix covers utility programs found in `contrib`. Once installed, either from source or a packaging system, they are found in the `bin` directory of the PostgreSQL installation and can be used like any other program.
