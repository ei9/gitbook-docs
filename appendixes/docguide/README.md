PostgreSQL has four primary documentation formats:

* Plain text, for pre-installation information
* HTML, for on-line browsing and reference
* PDF, for printing
* man pages, for quick reference.

Additionally, a number of plain-text `README` files can be found throughout the PostgreSQL source tree, documenting various implementation issues.

HTML documentation and man pages are part of a standard distribution and are installed by default. PDF format documentation is available separately for download.
