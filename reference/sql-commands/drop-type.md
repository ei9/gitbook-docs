# DROP TYPE

DROP TYPE â€” remove a data type

### Synopsis

```
DROP TYPE [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

### Description

`DROP TYPE` removes a user-defined data type. Only the owner of a type can remove it.

### Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

Do not throw an error if the type does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

_`name`_

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the data type to remove.

`CASCADE`

Automatically drop objects that depend on the type (such as table columns, functions, and operators), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-depend.html)).

`RESTRICT`

Refuse to drop the type if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

### Examples

To remove the data type `box`:

```
DROP TYPE box;
```

### Compatibility

This command is similar to the corresponding command in the SQL standard, apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension. But note that much of the `CREATE TYPE` command and the data type extension mechanisms in PostgreSQL differ from the SQL standard.
