# DROP TRIGGER

DROP TRIGGER â€” remove a trigger

### Synopsis

```
DROP TRIGGER [ IF EXISTS ] name ON table_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

### Description

`DROP TRIGGER` removes an existing trigger definition. To execute this command, the current user must be the owner of the table for which the trigger is defined.

### Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

Do not throw an error if the trigger does not exist. A notice is issued in this case._`name`_

The name of the trigger to remove._`table_name`_

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table for which the trigger is defined.`CASCADE`

Automatically drop objects that depend on the trigger, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-depend.html)).`RESTRICT`

Refuse to drop the trigger if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

### Examples

Destroy the trigger `if_dist_exists` on the table `films`:

```
DROP TRIGGER if_dist_exists ON films;
```

### Compatibility

The `DROP TRIGGER` statement in PostgreSQL is incompatible with the SQL standard. In the SQL standard, trigger names are not local to tables, so the command is simply `DROP TRIGGER`` `_`name`_.
