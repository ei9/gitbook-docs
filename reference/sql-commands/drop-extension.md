# DROP EXTENSION

DROP EXTENSION â€” remove an extension

## Synopsis

```
DROP EXTENSION [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

## Description

`DROP EXTENSION` removes extensions from the database. Dropping an extension causes its component objects to be dropped as well.

You must own the extension to use `DROP EXTENSION`.

## Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

Do not throw an error if the extension does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

_`name`_

The name of an installed extension.

`CASCADE`

Automatically drop objects that depend on the extension, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/ddl-depend.html)).

`RESTRICT`

Refuse to drop the extension if any objects depend on it (other than its own member objects and other extensions listed in the same `DROP` command). This is the default.

## Examples

To remove the extension `hstore` from the current database:

```
DROP EXTENSION hstore;
```

This command will fail if any of `hstore`'s objects are in use in the database, for example if any tables have columns of the `hstore` type. Add the `CASCADE` option to forcibly remove those dependent objects as well.

## Compatibility

`DROP EXTENSION` is a PostgreSQL extension.
