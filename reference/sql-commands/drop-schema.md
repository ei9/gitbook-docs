# DROP SCHEMA

DROP SCHEMA â€” remove a schema

### Synopsis

```
DROP SCHEMA [ IF EXISTS ] name [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

### Description

`DROP SCHEMA` removes schemas from the database.

A schema can only be dropped by its owner or a superuser. Note that the owner can drop the schema (and thereby all contained objects) even if they do not own some of the objects within the schema.

### Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

Do not throw an error if the schema does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

_`name`_

The name of a schema.

`CASCADE`

Automatically drop objects (tables, functions, etc.) that are contained in the schema, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-depend.html)).

`RESTRICT`

Refuse to drop the schema if it contains any objects. This is the default.

### Notes

Using the `CASCADE` option might make the command remove objects in other schemas besides the one(s) named.

### Examples

To remove schema `mystuff` from the database, along with everything it contains:

```
DROP SCHEMA mystuff CASCADE;
```

### Compatibility

`DROP SCHEMA` is fully conforming with the SQL standard, except that the standard only allows one schema to be dropped per command, and apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a PostgreSQL extension.
