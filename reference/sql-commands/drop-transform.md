# DROP TRANSFORM

DROP TRANSFORM â€” remove a transform

### Synopsis

```
DROP TRANSFORM [ IF EXISTS ] FOR type_name LANGUAGE lang_name [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

### Description

`DROP TRANSFORM` removes a previously defined transform.

To be able to drop a transform, you must own the type and the language. These are the same privileges that are required to create a transform.

### Parameters

`IF EXISTS`

Do not throw an error if the transform does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

_`type_name`_

The name of the data type of the transform.

_`lang_name`_

The name of the language of the transform.

`CASCADE`

Automatically drop objects that depend on the transform, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects (see [Section 5.13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-depend.html)).

`RESTRICT`

Refuse to drop the transform if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

### Examples

To drop the transform for type `hstore` and language `plpythonu`:

```
DROP TRANSFORM FOR hstore LANGUAGE plpythonu;
```

### Compatibility

This form of `DROP TRANSFORM` is a PostgreSQL extension. See [CREATE TRANSFORM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/sql-createtransform.html) for details.
