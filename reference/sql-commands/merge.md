# MERGE

MERGE — 有條件地 INSERT、UPDATE 或 DELETE 資料

### 語法

```sql
[ WITH with_query [, ...] ]
MERGE INTO [ ONLY ] target_table_name [ * ] [ [ AS ] target_alias ]
USING data_source ON join_condition
when_clause [...]

where data_source is:

{ [ ONLY ] source_table_name [ * ] | ( source_query ) } [ [ AS ] source_alias ]

and when_clause is:

{ WHEN MATCHED [ AND condition ] THEN { merge_update | merge_delete | DO NOTHING } |
  WHEN NOT MATCHED [ AND condition ] THEN { merge_insert | DO NOTHING } }

and merge_insert is:

INSERT [( column_name [, ...] )]
[ OVERRIDING { SYSTEM | USER } VALUE ]
{ VALUES ( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) | DEFAULT VALUES }

and merge_update is:

UPDATE SET { column_name = { expression | DEFAULT } |
             ( column_name [, ...] ) = ( { expression | DEFAULT } [, ...] ) } [, ...]

and merge_delete is:

DELETE
```

### 說明

MERGE 使用 data\_source 執行修改 target\_table\_name 中資料的操作。MERGE 提供單個 SQL 語句，便能以指定條件插入、更新或刪除資料，否則這項作業通常需要多個操作程序。

First, the `MERGE` command performs a join from _`data_source`_ to _`target_table_name`_ producing zero or more candidate change rows. For each candidate change row, the status of `MATCHED` or `NOT MATCHED` is set just once, after which `WHEN` clauses are evaluated in the order specified. For each candidate change row, the first clause to evaluate as true is executed. No more than one `WHEN` clause is executed for any candidate change row.

`MERGE` actions have the same effect as regular `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` commands of the same names. The syntax of those commands is different, notably that there is no `WHERE` clause and no table name is specified. All actions refer to the _`target_table_name`_, though modifications to other tables may be made using triggers.

When `DO NOTHING` is specified, the source row is skipped. Since actions are evaluated in their specified order, `DO NOTHING` can be handy to skip non-interesting source rows before more fine-grained handling.

There is no separate `MERGE` privilege. If you specify an update action, you must have the `UPDATE` privilege on the column(s) of the _`target_table_name`_ that are referred to in the `SET` clause. If you specify an insert action, you must have the `INSERT` privilege on the _`target_table_name`_. If you specify an delete action, you must have the `DELETE` privilege on the _`target_table_name`_. Privileges are tested once at statement start and are checked whether or not particular `WHEN` clauses are executed. You will require the `SELECT` privilege on the _`data_source`_ and any column(s) of the _`target_table_name`_ referred to in a `condition`.

`MERGE` is not supported if the _`target_table_name`_ is a materialized view, foreign table, or if it has any rules defined on it.

### Parameters

_`target_table_name`_

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the target table to merge into. If `ONLY` is specified before the table name, matching rows are updated or deleted in the named table only. If `ONLY` is not specified, matching rows are also updated or deleted in any tables inheriting from the named table. Optionally, `*` can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included. The `ONLY` keyword and `*` option do not affect insert actions, which always insert into the named table only.

_`target_alias`_

A substitute name for the target table. When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table. For example, given `MERGE INTO foo AS f`, the remainder of the `MERGE` statement must refer to this table as `f` not `foo`.

_`source_table_name`_

The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the source table, view, or transition table. If `ONLY` is specified before the table name, matching rows are included from the named table only. If `ONLY` is not specified, matching rows are also included from any tables inheriting from the named table. Optionally, `*` can be specified after the table name to explicitly indicate that descendant tables are included.

_`source_query`_

A query (`SELECT` statement or `VALUES` statement) that supplies the rows to be merged into the _`target_table_name`_. Refer to the [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-select.html) statement or [VALUES](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-values.html) statement for a description of the syntax.

_`source_alias`_

A substitute name for the data source. When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table or the fact that a query was issued.

_`join_condition`_

_`join_condition`_ is an expression resulting in a value of type `boolean` (similar to a `WHERE` clause) that specifies which rows in the _`data_source`_ match rows in the _`target_table_name`_.

#### Warning

Only columns from _`target_table_name`_ that attempt to match _`data_source`_ rows should appear in _`join_condition`_. _`join_condition`_ subexpressions that only reference _`target_table_name`_ columns can affect which action is taken, often in surprising ways.

_`when_clause`_

At least one `WHEN` clause is required.

If the `WHEN` clause specifies `WHEN MATCHED` and the candidate change row matches a row in the _`target_table_name`_, the `WHEN` clause is executed if the _`condition`_ is absent or it evaluates to `true`.

Conversely, if the `WHEN` clause specifies `WHEN NOT MATCHED` and the candidate change row does not match a row in the _`target_table_name`_, the `WHEN` clause is executed if the _`condition`_ is absent or it evaluates to `true`.

_`condition`_

An expression that returns a value of type `boolean`. If this expression for a `WHEN` clause returns `true`, then the action for that clause is executed for that row.

A condition on a `WHEN MATCHED` clause can refer to columns in both the source and the target relations. A condition on a `WHEN NOT MATCHED` clause can only refer to columns from the source relation, since by definition there is no matching target row. Only the system attributes from the target table are accessible.

_`merge_insert`_

The specification of an `INSERT` action that inserts one row into the target table. The target column names can be listed in any order. If no list of column names is given at all, the default is all the columns of the table in their declared order.

Each column not present in the explicit or implicit column list will be filled with a default value, either its declared default value or null if there is none.

If _`target_table_name`_ is a partitioned table, each row is routed to the appropriate partition and inserted into it. If _`target_table_name`_ is a partition, an error will occur if any input row violates the partition constraint.

Column names may not be specified more than once. `INSERT` actions cannot contain sub-selects.

Only one `VALUES` clause can be specified. The `VALUES` clause can only refer to columns from the source relation, since by definition there is no matching target row.

_`merge_update`_

The specification of an `UPDATE` action that updates the current row of the _`target_table_name`_. Column names may not be specified more than once.

Neither a table name nor a `WHERE` clause are allowed.

_`merge_delete`_

Specifies a `DELETE` action that deletes the current row of the _`target_table_name`_. Do not include the table name or any other clauses, as you would normally do with a [DELETE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-delete.html) command.

_`column_name`_

The name of a column in the _`target_table_name`_. The column name can be qualified with a subfield name or array subscript, if needed. (Inserting into only some fields of a composite column leaves the other fields null.) Do not include the table's name in the specification of a target column.

`OVERRIDING SYSTEM VALUE`

Without this clause, it is an error to specify an explicit value (other than `DEFAULT`) for an identity column defined as `GENERATED ALWAYS`. This clause overrides that restriction.

`OVERRIDING USER VALUE`

If this clause is specified, then any values supplied for identity columns defined as `GENERATED BY DEFAULT` are ignored and the default sequence-generated values are applied.

`DEFAULT VALUES`

All columns will be filled with their default values. (An `OVERRIDING` clause is not permitted in this form.)

_`expression`_

An expression to assign to the column. If used in a `WHEN MATCHED` clause, the expression can use values from the original row in the target table, and values from the `data_source` row. If used in a `WHEN NOT MATCHED` clause, the expression can use values from the `data_source`.

`DEFAULT`

Set the column to its default value (which will be `NULL` if no specific default expression has been assigned to it).

_`with_query`_

The `WITH` clause allows you to specify one or more subqueries that can be referenced by name in the `MERGE` query. See [Section 7.8](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/queries-with.html) and [SELECT](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-select.html) for details.

### Outputs

On successful completion, a `MERGE` command returns a command tag of the form

```
MERGE total_count
```

The _`total_count`_ is the total number of rows changed (whether inserted, updated, or deleted). If _`total_count`_ is 0, no rows were changed in any way.

### Notes

The following steps take place during the execution of `MERGE`.

1. Perform any `BEFORE STATEMENT` triggers for all actions specified, whether or not their `WHEN` clauses match.
2. Perform a join from source to target table. The resulting query will be optimized normally and will produce a set of candidate change rows. For each candidate change row,
   1. Evaluate whether each row is `MATCHED` or `NOT MATCHED`.
   2. Test each `WHEN` condition in the order specified until one returns true.
   3. When a condition returns true, perform the following actions:
      1. Perform any `BEFORE ROW` triggers that fire for the action's event type.
      2. Perform the specified action, invoking any check constraints on the target table.
      3. Perform any `AFTER ROW` triggers that fire for the action's event type.
3. Perform any `AFTER STATEMENT` triggers for actions specified, whether or not they actually occur. This is similar to the behavior of an `UPDATE` statement that modifies no rows.

In summary, statement triggers for an event type (say, `INSERT`) will be fired whenever we _specify_ an action of that kind. In contrast, row-level triggers will fire only for the specific event type being _executed_. So a `MERGE` command might fire statement triggers for both `UPDATE` and `INSERT`, even though only `UPDATE` row triggers were fired.

You should ensure that the join produces at most one candidate change row for each target row. In other words, a target row shouldn't join to more than one data source row. If it does, then only one of the candidate change rows will be used to modify the target row; later attempts to modify the row will cause an error. This can also occur if row triggers make changes to the target table and the rows so modified are then subsequently also modified by `MERGE`. If the repeated action is an `INSERT`, this will cause a uniqueness violation, while a repeated `UPDATE` or `DELETE` will cause a cardinality violation; the latter behavior is required by the SQL standard. This differs from historical PostgreSQL behavior of joins in `UPDATE` and `DELETE` statements where second and subsequent attempts to modify the same row are simply ignored.

If a `WHEN` clause omits an `AND` sub-clause, it becomes the final reachable clause of that kind (`MATCHED` or `NOT MATCHED`). If a later `WHEN` clause of that kind is specified it would be provably unreachable and an error is raised. If no final reachable clause is specified of either kind, it is possible that no action will be taken for a candidate change row.

The order in which rows are generated from the data source is indeterminate by default. A _`source_query`_ can be used to specify a consistent ordering, if required, which might be needed to avoid deadlocks between concurrent transactions.

There is no `RETURNING` clause with `MERGE`. Actions of `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` cannot contain `RETURNING` or `WITH` clauses.

When `MERGE` is run concurrently with other commands that modify the target table, the usual transaction isolation rules apply; see [Section 13.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/transaction-iso.html) for an explanation on the behavior at each isolation level. You may also wish to consider using `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` as an alternative statement which offers the ability to run an `UPDATE` if a concurrent `INSERT` occurs. There are a variety of differences and restrictions between the two statement types and they are not interchangeable.

### 範例

根據新的 recent\_transactions 對 customer\_accounts 進行資料維護。

```sql
MERGE INTO customer_account ca
USING recent_transactions t
ON t.customer_id = ca.customer_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET balance = balance + transaction_value
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (customer_id, balance)
  VALUES (t.customer_id, t.transaction_value);
```

請注意，這將完全等同於以下語句，因為 MATCHED 結果在執行期間並不會改變。

```sql
MERGE INTO customer_account ca
USING (SELECT customer_id, transaction_value FROM recent_transactions) AS t
ON t.customer_id = ca.customer_id
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  UPDATE SET balance = balance + transaction_value
WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN
  INSERT (customer_id, balance)
  VALUES (t.customer_id, t.transaction_value);
```

嘗試插入新的庫存項目以及庫存數量。 如果該項目已經存在，則更新現有項目的庫存數量，並且不允許有零庫存的項目。

```sql
MERGE INTO wines w
USING wine_stock_changes s
ON s.winename = w.winename
WHEN NOT MATCHED AND s.stock_delta > 0 THEN
  INSERT VALUES(s.winename, s.stock_delta)
WHEN MATCHED AND w.stock + s.stock_delta > 0 THEN
  UPDATE SET stock = w.stock + s.stock_delta
WHEN MATCHED THEN
  DELETE;
```

在此例中，wine\_stock\_changes 資料表可能是最近加入到資料庫中的臨時資料庫表。

### Compatibility

This command conforms to the SQL standard.

The WITH clause and `DO NOTHING` action are extensions to the SQL standard.
