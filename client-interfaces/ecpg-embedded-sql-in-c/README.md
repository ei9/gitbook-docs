# 36. ECPG - Embedded SQL in C

This chapter describes the embedded SQL package for PostgreSQL. It was written by Linus Tolke (`<`[`linus@epact.se`](mailto:linus@epact.se)`>`) and Michael Meskes (`<`[`meskes@postgresql.org`](mailto:meskes@postgresql.org)`>`). Originally it was written to work with C. It also works with C++, but it does not recognize all C++ constructs yet.

This documentation is quite incomplete. But since this interface is standardized, additional information can be found in many resources about SQL.
