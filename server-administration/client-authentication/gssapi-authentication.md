# 21.6. GSSAPI Authentication

GSSAPI is an industry-standard protocol for secure authentication defined in [RFC 2743](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2743). PostgreSQL supports GSSAPI for authentication, communications encryption, or both. GSSAPI provides automatic authentication (single sign-on) for systems that support it. The authentication itself is secure. If GSSAPI encryption or SSL encryption is used, the data sent along the database connection will be encrypted; otherwise, it will not.

GSSAPI support has to be enabled when PostgreSQL is built; see [Chapter 16](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/installation.html) for more information.

When GSSAPI uses Kerberos, it uses a standard service principal (authentication identity) name in the format _`servicename`_/_`hostname`_@_`realm`_. The principal name used by a particular installation is not encoded in the PostgreSQL server in any way; rather it is specified in the _keytab_ file that the server reads to determine its identity. If multiple principals are listed in the keytab file, the server will accept any one of them. The server's realm name is the preferred realm specified in the Kerberos configuration file(s) accessible to the server.

When connecting, the client must know the principal name of the server it intends to connect to. The _`servicename`_ part of the principal is ordinarily `postgres`, but another value can be selected via libpq's [krbsrvname](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNECT-KRBSRVNAME) connection parameter. The _`hostname`_ part is the fully qualified host name that libpq is told to connect to. The realm name is the preferred realm specified in the Kerberos configuration file(s) accessible to the client.

The client will also have a principal name for its own identity (and it must have a valid ticket for this principal). To use GSSAPI for authentication, the client principal must be associated with a PostgreSQL database user name. The `pg_ident.conf` configuration file can be used to map principals to user names; for example, `pgusername@realm` could be mapped to just `pgusername`. Alternatively, you can use the full `username@realm` principal as the role name in PostgreSQL without any mapping.

PostgreSQL also supports mapping client principals to user names by just stripping the realm from the principal. This method is supported for backwards compatibility and is strongly discouraged as it is then impossible to distinguish different users with the same user name but coming from different realms. To enable this, set `include_realm` to 0. For simple single-realm installations, doing that combined with setting the `krb_realm` parameter (which checks that the principal's realm matches exactly what is in the `krb_realm` parameter) is still secure; but this is a less capable approach compared to specifying an explicit mapping in `pg_ident.conf`.

The location of the server's keytab file is specified by the [krb\_server\_keyfile](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-KRB-SERVER-KEYFILE) configuration parameter. For security reasons, it is recommended to use a separate keytab just for the PostgreSQL server rather than allowing the server to read the system keytab file. Make sure that your server keytab file is readable (and preferably only readable, not writable) by the PostgreSQL server account. (See also [Section 18.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/postgres-user.html).)

The keytab file is generated using the Kerberos software; see the Kerberos documentation for details. The following example shows doing this using the kadmin tool of MIT-compatible Kerberos 5 implementations:

```
kadmin% addprinc -randkey postgres/server.my.domain.org
kadmin% ktadd -k krb5.keytab postgres/server.my.domain.org
```

The following authentication options are supported for the GSSAPI authentication method:

`include_realm`

If set to 0, the realm name from the authenticated user principal is stripped off before being passed through the user name mapping ([Section 20.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/auth-username-maps.html)). This is discouraged and is primarily available for backwards compatibility, as it is not secure in multi-realm environments unless `krb_realm` is also used. It is recommended to leave `include_realm` set to the default (1) and to provide an explicit mapping in `pg_ident.conf` to convert principal names to PostgreSQL user names.

`map`

Allows mapping from client principals to database user names. See [Section 20.2](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/auth-username-maps.html) for details. For a GSSAPI/Kerberos principal, such as `username@EXAMPLE.COM` (or, less commonly, `username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM`), the user name used for mapping is `username@EXAMPLE.COM` (or `username/hostbased@EXAMPLE.COM`, respectively), unless `include_realm` has been set to 0, in which case `username` (or `username/hostbased`) is what is seen as the system user name when mapping.

`krb_realm`

Sets the realm to match user principal names against. If this parameter is set, only users of that realm will be accepted. If it is not set, users of any realm can connect, subject to whatever user name mapping is done.

In addition to these settings, which can be different for different `pg_hba.conf` entries, there is the server-wide [krb\_caseins\_users](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-connection.html#GUC-KRB-CASEINS-USERS) configuration parameter. If that is set to true, client principals are matched to user map entries case-insensitively. `krb_realm`, if set, is also matched case-insensitively.
