# 28.4. Progress Reporting

PostgreSQL has the ability to report the progress of certain commands during command execution. Currently, the only commands which support progress reporting are `ANALYZE`, `CLUSTER`, `CREATE INDEX`, `VACUUM`, `COPY`, and [BASE\_BACKUP](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/protocol-replication.html#PROTOCOL-REPLICATION-BASE-BACKUP) (i.e., replication command that [pg\_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-pgbasebackup.html) issues to take a base backup). This may be expanded in the future.

## 28.4.1. ANALYZE Progress Reporting

Whenever `ANALYZE` is running, the `pg_stat_progress_analyze` view will contain a row for each backend that is currently running that command. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.

| Phase                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `initializing`                    | The command is preparing to begin scanning the heap. This phase is expected to be very brief.                                                                                                             |
| `acquiring sample rows`           | The command is currently scanning the table given by `relid` to obtain sample rows.                                                                                                                       |
| `acquiring inherited sample rows` | The command is currently scanning child tables to obtain sample rows. Columns `child_tables_total`, `child_tables_done`, and `current_child_table_relid` contain the progress information for this phase. |
| `computing statistics`            | The command is computing statistics from the sample rows obtained during the table scan.                                                                                                                  |
| `computing extended statistics`   | The command is computing extended statistics from the sample rows obtained during the table scan.                                                                                                         |
| `finalizing analyze`              | The command is updating `pg_class`. When this phase is completed, `ANALYZE` will end.                                                                                                                     |

#### Note

Note that when `ANALYZE` is run on a partitioned table, all of its partitions are also recursively analyzed. In that case, `ANALYZE` progress is reported first for the parent table, whereby its inheritance statistics are collected, followed by that for each partition.

## 28.4.2. CREATE INDEX Progress Reporting

Whenever `CREATE INDEX` or `REINDEX` is running, the `pg_stat_progress_create_index` view will contain one row for each backend that is currently creating indexes. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.

#### **Table 28.38. `pg_stat_progress_create_index` View**

In this phase, access methods that support progress reporting fill in their own progress data, and the subphase is indicated in this column. Typically, `blocks_total` and `blocks_done` will contain progress data, as well as potentially `tuples_total` and `tuples_done`. |
| `waiting for writers before validation`   | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with write locks that can potentially write into the table to finish. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `lockers_total`, `lockers_done` and `current_locker_pid` contain the progress information for this phase.               |
| `index validation: scanning index`        | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is scanning the index searching for tuples that need to be validated. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `blocks_total` (set to the total size of the index) and `blocks_done` contain the progress information for this phase.                                                        |

| `index validation: scanning table`        | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is scanning the table to validate the index tuples collected in the previous two phases. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `blocks_total` (set to the total size of the table) and `blocks_done` contain the progress information for this phase.                                     |
| `waiting for old snapshots`               | `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` or `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions that can potentially see the table to release their snapshots. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `lockers_total`, `lockers_done` and `current_locker_pid` contain the progress information for this phase.                      |
| `waiting for readers before marking dead` | `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with read locks on the table to finish, before marking the old index dead. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `lockers_total`, `lockers_done` and `current_locker_pid` contain the progress information for this phase.                                         |
| `waiting for readers before dropping`     | `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` is waiting for transactions with read locks on the table to finish, before dropping the old index. This phase is skipped when not in concurrent mode. Columns `lockers_total`, `lockers_done` and `current_locker_pid` contain the progress information for this phase.                                             |

## 28.4.3. VACUUM Progress Reporting

Whenever `VACUUM` is running, the `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` view will contain one row for each backend (including autovacuum worker processes) that is currently vacuuming. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it. Progress for `VACUUM FULL` commands is reported via `pg_stat_progress_cluster` because both `VACUUM FULL` and `CLUSTER` rewrite the table, while regular `VACUUM` only modifies it in place.

| `initializing`             | `VACUUM` is preparing to begin scanning the heap. This phase is expected to be very brief.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `scanning heap`            | `VACUUM` is currently scanning the heap. It will prune and defragment each page if required, and possibly perform freezing activity. The `heap_blks_scanned` column can be used to monitor the progress of the scan.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `vacuuming indexes`        | `VACUUM` is currently vacuuming the indexes. If a table has any indexes, this will happen at least once per vacuum, after the heap has been completely scanned. It may happen multiple times per vacuum if [maintenance\_work\_mem](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAINTENANCE-WORK-MEM) (or, in the case of autovacuum, [autovacuum\_work\_mem](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-AUTOVACUUM-WORK-MEM) if set) is insufficient to store the number of dead tuples found. |
| `vacuuming heap`           | `VACUUM` is currently vacuuming the heap. Vacuuming the heap is distinct from scanning the heap, and occurs after each instance of vacuuming indexes. If `heap_blks_scanned` is less than `heap_blks_total`, the system will return to scanning the heap after this phase is completed; otherwise, it will begin cleaning up indexes after this phase is completed.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `cleaning up indexes`      | `VACUUM` is currently cleaning up indexes. This occurs after the heap has been completely scanned and all vacuuming of the indexes and the heap has been completed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `truncating heap`          | `VACUUM` is currently truncating the heap so as to return empty pages at the end of the relation to the operating system. This occurs after cleaning up indexes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `performing final cleanup` | `VACUUM` is performing final cleanup. During this phase, `VACUUM` will vacuum the free space map, update statistics in `pg_class`, and report statistics to the cumulative statistics system. When this phase is completed, `VACUUM` will end.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

## 28.4.4. CLUSTER Progress Reporting

Whenever `CLUSTER` or `VACUUM FULL` is running, the `pg_stat_progress_cluster` view will contain a row for each backend that is currently running either command. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.

## 28.4.5. Base Backup Progress Reporting

Whenever an application like pg\_basebackup is taking a base backup, the `pg_stat_progress_basebackup` view will contain a row for each WAL sender process that is currently running the `BASE_BACKUP` replication command and streaming the backup. The tables below describe the information that will be reported and provide information about how to interpret it.
