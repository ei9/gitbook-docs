# 51.49. pg\_statistic

The catalog `pg_statistic` stores statistical data about the contents of the database. Entries are created by [ANALYZE](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/sql-analyze.html) and subsequently used by the query planner. Note that all the statistical data is inherently approximate, even assuming that it is up-to-date.

Normally there is one entry, with `stainherit` = `false`, for each table column that has been analyzed. If the table has inheritance children, a second entry with `stainherit` = `true` is also created. This row represents the column's statistics over the inheritance tree, i.e., statistics for the data you'd see with `SELECT`` `_`column`_ FROM _`table`_\*, whereas the `stainherit` = `false` row represents the results of `SELECT`` `_`column`_ FROM ONLY _`table`_.

`pg_statistic` also stores statistical data about the values of index expressions. These are described as if they were actual data columns; in particular, `starelid` references the index. No entry is made for an ordinary non-expression index column, however, since it would be redundant with the entry for the underlying table column. Currently, entries for index expressions always have `stainherit` = `false`.

Since different kinds of statistics might be appropriate for different kinds of data, `pg_statistic` is designed not to assume very much about what sort of statistics it stores. Only extremely general statistics (such as nullness) are given dedicated columns in `pg_statistic`. Everything else is stored in “slots”, which are groups of associated columns whose content is identified by a code number in one of the slot's columns. For more information see `src/include/catalog/pg_statistic.h`.

`pg_statistic` should not be readable by the public, since even statistical information about a table's contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: minimum and maximum values of a salary column might be quite interesting.) [`pg_stats`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/view-pg-stats.html) is a publicly readable view on `pg_statistic` that only exposes information about those tables that are readable by the current user.
