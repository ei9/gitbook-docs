# 51.7. pg\_attribute

The catalog `pg_attribute` stores information about table columns. There will be exactly one `pg_attribute` row for every column in every table in the database. (There will also be attribute entries for indexes, and indeed all objects that have `pg_class` entries.)

The term attribute is equivalent to column and is used for historical reasons.

For scalar data types, `attstattarget` is both the target number of “most common values” to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create. |

In a dropped column's `pg_attribute` entry, `atttypid` is reset to zero, but `attlen` and the other fields copied from `pg_type` are still valid. This arrangement is needed to cope with the situation where the dropped column's data type was later dropped, and so there is no `pg_type` row anymore. `attlen` and the other fields can be used to interpret the contents of a row of the table.
