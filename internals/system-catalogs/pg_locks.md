# 51.73. pg\_locks

The view `pg_locks` provides access to information about the locks held by active processes within the database server. See [Chapter 13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/mvcc.html) for more discussion of locking.

`pg_locks` contains one row per active lockable object, requested lock mode, and relevant process. Thus, the same lockable object might appear many times, if multiple processes are holding or waiting for locks on it. However, an object that currently has no locks on it will not appear at all.

There are several distinct types of lockable objects: whole relations (e.g., tables), individual pages of relations, individual tuples of relations, transaction IDs (both virtual and permanent IDs), and general database objects (identified by class OID and object OID, in the same way as in `pg_description` or `pg_depend`). Also, the right to extend a relation is represented as a separate lockable object, as is the right to update `pg_database`.`datfrozenxid`. Also, “advisory” locks can be taken on numbers that have user-defined meanings.

granted 為 true 的話，代表此鎖定由該筆資料的程序所持有。False 表示此程序目前正在等待取得鎖定，這意味著至少一個其他程序正持有或等待同一可鎖定物件上在鎖定模式有衝突。等待的程序將會一直休眠，直到另一個鎖定被釋放（或檢測到 deadlock 情況）為止。一個程序等待最多只可以取得一個鎖定。

在整個交易事務執行過程中，伺服器程序對事務的虛擬事務 ID 持有排他鎖定(exclusive lock)。如果將永久性 ID 分配給事務（通常僅在事務變更資料庫狀態時才會發生），它還會對事務的永久性事務 ID 持有排他鎖定，直到結束。當一個程序發現有必要專門等待另一個事務結束時，它透過嘗試獲取另一個事務的 ID（取決於情況的虛擬 ID 或永久 ID）上的共享鎖定(share lock)來做到這一點。僅當另一個事務結束並釋放其鎖定時，該操作才會成功。

儘管 tuple 是可鎖定的物件型別，但是有關資料列級鎖定的資訊是儲存在磁碟上，而不是儲存在記憶體之中，因此資料列級的鎖定通常不會出現在此檢視表中。如果程序正在等待資料列級的鎖定，則它通常在檢視表中顯示為正在等待該資料列鎖定目前持有者的永久事務 ID。

Advisory locks can be acquired on keys consisting of either a single `bigint` value or two integer values. A `bigint` key is displayed with its high-order half in the `classid` column, its low-order half in the `objid` column, and `objsubid` equal to 1. The original `bigint` value can be reassembled with the expression `(classid::bigint << 32) | objid::bigint`. Integer keys are displayed with the first key in the `classid` column, the second key in the `objid` column, and `objsubid` equal to 2. The actual meaning of the keys is up to the user. Advisory locks are local to each database, so the `database` column is meaningful for an advisory lock.

`pg_locks` provides a global view of all locks in the database cluster, not only those relevant to the current database. Although its `relation` column can be joined against `pg_class`.`oid` to identify locked relations, this will only work correctly for relations in the current database (those for which the `database` column is either the current database's OID or zero).

The `pid` column can be joined to the `pid` column of the [`pg_stat_activity`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW) view to get more information on the session holding or awaiting each lock, for example

```
SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_stat_activity psa
    ON pl.pid = psa.pid;
```

Also, if you are using prepared transactions, the `virtualtransaction` column can be joined to the `transaction` column of the [`pg_prepared_xacts`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/view-pg-prepared-xacts.html) view to get more information on prepared transactions that hold locks. (A prepared transaction can never be waiting for a lock, but it continues to hold the locks it acquired while running.) For example:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_locks pl LEFT JOIN pg_prepared_xacts ppx
    ON pl.virtualtransaction = '-1/' || ppx.transaction;
```

While it is possible to obtain information about which processes block which other processes by joining `pg_locks` against itself, this is very difficult to get right in detail. Such a query would have to encode knowledge about which lock modes conflict with which others. Worse, the `pg_locks` view does not expose information about which processes are ahead of which others in lock wait queues, nor information about which processes are parallel workers running on behalf of which other client sessions. It is better to use the `pg_blocking_pids()` function (see [Table 9.63](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SESSION-TABLE)) to identify which process(es) a waiting process is blocked behind.

The `pg_locks` view displays data from both the regular lock manager and the predicate lock manager, which are separate systems; in addition, the regular lock manager subdivides its locks into regular and _fast-path_ locks. This data is not guaranteed to be entirely consistent. When the view is queried, data on fast-path locks (with `fastpath` = `true`) is gathered from each backend one at a time, without freezing the state of the entire lock manager, so it is possible for locks to be taken or released while information is gathered. Note, however, that these locks are known not to conflict with any other lock currently in place. After all backends have been queried for fast-path locks, the remainder of the regular lock manager is locked as a unit, and a consistent snapshot of all remaining locks is collected as an atomic action. After unlocking the regular lock manager, the predicate lock manager is similarly locked and all predicate locks are collected as an atomic action. Thus, with the exception of fast-path locks, each lock manager will deliver a consistent set of results, but as we do not lock both lock managers simultaneously, it is possible for locks to be taken or released after we interrogate the regular lock manager and before we interrogate the predicate lock manager.

Locking the regular and/or predicate lock manager could have some impact on database performance if this view is very frequently accessed. The locks are held only for the minimum amount of time necessary to obtain data from the lock managers, but this does not completely eliminate the possibility of a performance impact.\\
