# 67.2. Behavior of B-Tree Operator Classes

As shown in [Table 38.3](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/xindex.html#XINDEX-BTREE-STRAT-TABLE), a btree operator class must provide five comparison operators, `<`, `<=`, `=`, `>=` and `>`. One might expect that `<>` should also be part of the operator class, but it is not, because it would almost never be useful to use a `<>` WHERE clause in an index search. (For some purposes, the planner treats `<>` as associated with a btree operator class; but it finds that operator via the `=` operator's negator link, rather than from `pg_amop`.)

When several data types share near-identical sorting semantics, their operator classes can be grouped into an operator family. Doing so is advantageous because it allows the planner to make deductions about cross-type comparisons. Each operator class within the family should contain the single-type operators (and associated support functions) for its input data type, while cross-type comparison operators and support functions are “loose” in the family. It is recommendable that a complete set of cross-type operators be included in the family, thus ensuring that the planner can represent any comparison conditions that it deduces from transitivity.

There are some basic assumptions that a btree operator family must satisfy:

* An `=` operator must be an equivalence relation; that is, for all non-null values _`A`_, _`B`_, _`C`_ of the data type:
  * _`A`_ `=` _`A`_ is true (_reflexive law_)
  * if _`A`_ `=` _`B`_, then _`B`_ `=` _`A`_ (_symmetric law_)
  * if _`A`_ `=` _`B`_ and _`B`_ `=` _`C`_, then _`A`_ `=` _`C`_ (_transitive law_)
* A `<` operator must be a strong ordering relation; that is, for all non-null values _`A`_, _`B`_, _`C`_:
  * _`A`_ `<` _`A`_ is false (_irreflexive law_)
  * if _`A`_ `<` _`B`_ and _`B`_ `<` _`C`_, then _`A`_ `<` _`C`_ (_transitive law_)
*   Furthermore, the ordering is total; that is, for all non-null values _`A`_, _`B`_:

    * exactly one of _`A`_ `<` _`B`_, _`A`_ `=` _`B`_, and _`B`_ `<` _`A`_ is true (_trichotomy law_)

    (The trichotomy law justifies the definition of the comparison support function, of course.)

The other three operators are defined in terms of `=` and `<` in the obvious way, and must act consistently with them.

For an operator family supporting multiple data types, the above laws must hold when _`A`_, _`B`_, _`C`_ are taken from any data types in the family. The transitive laws are the trickiest to ensure, as in cross-type situations they represent statements that the behaviors of two or three different operators are consistent. As an example, it would not work to put `float8` and `numeric` into the same operator family, at least not with the current semantics that `numeric` values are converted to `float8` for comparison to a `float8`. Because of the limited accuracy of `float8`, this means there are distinct `numeric` values that will compare equal to the same `float8` value, and thus the transitive law would fail.

Another requirement for a multiple-data-type family is that any implicit or binary-coercion casts that are defined between data types included in the operator family must not change the associated sort ordering.

It should be fairly clear why a btree index requires these laws to hold within a single data type: without them there is no ordering to arrange the keys with. Also, index searches using a comparison key of a different data type require comparisons to behave sanely across two data types. The extensions to three or more data types within a family are not strictly required by the btree index mechanism itself, but the planner relies on them for optimization purposes.
