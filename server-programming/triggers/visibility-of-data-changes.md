# 39.2. Visibility of Data Changes

If you execute SQL commands in your trigger function, and these commands access the table that the trigger is for, then you need to be aware of the data visibility rules, because they determine whether these SQL commands will see the data change that the trigger is fired for. Briefly:

* Statement-level triggers follow simple visibility rules: none of the changes made by a statement are visible to statement-level `BEFORE` triggers, whereas all modifications are visible to statement-level `AFTER` triggers.
* The data change (insertion, update, or deletion) causing the trigger to fire is naturally _not_ visible to SQL commands executed in a row-level `BEFORE` trigger, because it hasn't happened yet.
* However, SQL commands executed in a row-level `BEFORE` trigger _will_ see the effects of data changes for rows previously processed in the same outer command. This requires caution, since the ordering of these change events is not in general predictable; an SQL command that affects multiple rows can visit the rows in any order.
* Similarly, a row-level `INSTEAD OF` trigger will see the effects of data changes made by previous firings of `INSTEAD OF` triggers in the same outer command.
* When a row-level `AFTER` trigger is fired, all data changes made by the outer command are already complete, and are visible to the invoked trigger function.

If your trigger function is written in any of the standard procedural languages, then the above statements apply only if the function is declared `VOLATILE`. Functions that are declared `STABLE` or `IMMUTABLE` will not see changes made by the calling command in any case.

Further information about data visibility rules can be found in [Section 47.5](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/spi-visibility.html). The example in [Section 39.4](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/trigger-example.html) contains a demonstration of these rules.
